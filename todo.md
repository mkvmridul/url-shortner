1. features to be added
	a. tracking (timestamp, analytics) etc...
	b. authentications
	c. url validations can be improved like: check if url actually exists by pinging.

2. Minification algorithm
currently used algorithm can be further improved to avoid collisions and save data to further minifying the url

3. Scaling
Searching is fast in current design though insertion is still slow relatively and in case or further scaling things will get complicated and unbalanced.
